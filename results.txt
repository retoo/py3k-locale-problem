  == strptime test ==

  When parsing date with strptime() Python usually ignores the locale and
  just assumes LANG=C.

  This test tries to parse the weekday 'Monday' and 'Montag'. With Python 3
  on OS X and a german locale only 'Montag' can be parsed.
  
Parsing 'Montag'. Result: Unable to detect (Value Error)
Parsing 'Monday'. Result: (1900, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1)


  ==float() test ==

  Float's contstructor is pretty locale indepdendent, it will recognize 1.7 as
  a number regardless the version of Python or the plattform.

  
1.7: 1.7
1,7: Unable to detect (Value Error)


  == atof() test (using a C extension) =="

  In this test the libc function atof() is being used to convert the string to
  a float. In Python 2.5 the C extension's atof appears to ignore the LOCALE
  and always expects a '.' as the decimal delimiter. With Python 3.0 on
  a OS X box with german locales the atof epxects the german delimiter ','.
  
1.7: 1.70000004768
1,7: 1.0
