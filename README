In this repo I briefly outline some locale-related problems with Python 3.

You can use the following steps to run the test/showcase:

$ python2.5 setup.py build
$ python3.0 setup.py build

To run the tests with python 2.5, enter:
$ (cd build/lib*-2.5; python2.5 py3k_locale_problem.py)
... for 3.0  ... 
$ (cd build/lib*-3.0; python3.0 py3k_locale_problem.py)

When manually setting LC_ALL=C, the differences disappear
